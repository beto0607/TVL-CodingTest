# TVL Test

## My solution

-   [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as language.
-   [Redux](http://Redux.js.org/) for state magnament: The list of topics, categories, where is each topic, if the user is dragging a topic, etc.
-   [React Native Elements](https://react-native-training.github.io/react-native-elements/) for some built-in components(Header, Texts).
-   FontAwesome for Icons.
-   [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) with [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/) for testing.
-   [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) for having unique keys and IDs.
-   [React Native Dialog](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-dialog) for showing a modal when you want to add a topic

## Instructions

For move the topics to a category, you can select a topic dragging on the dots in the left or tapping it. When dragging, a drop zone will appear in the categories and it'll change to a highlighted state when hover.

You can remove a topic from any category doing a tap in the X icon.

When a category has items, it could be expanded by tapping it to show them.

For adding topics, there is a button on bottom.
